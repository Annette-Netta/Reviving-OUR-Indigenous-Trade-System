        <p>OUR Ways are Strong and Sure.</p>  
        <p>Our Ways include sharing what we have across the lands.</p>
        <p>Remember a time when our Ancestors had an abundance of goods and they traded with others?</p>
        <p>Our people traded so we could share our resources and procure the resources we did not have.  Many miles on land and water were travelled to secure the needed supplies.
        </p>
        <p>Wherever we live on these lands, there is an abundance that Mother Earth provides for us.
        </p>
