        <p>Are you looking for fresh meat? Is the meat you're buying from the grocery store bothering your stomach or causing pain and inflammation in your body and joints?  Have you been thinking that there must be healthier meat that you can eat, but just haven't had the right contact to find it?  Do you ever think of the meat our Moms and Dads, Aunties and Uncles, and Grandparents ate would be so good to get, and that, just maybe, your stomach problems and aches and pains would be gone.

            <p><em>Remember</em> a time when our Ancestors had an abundance of goods and they traded with others?  We did not use money.  We used food and supplies that we had on hand.</p>
            <p>Our people traded so we could share our resources and procure the resources we did not have.  Many miles on land and water were travelled to secure the needed supplies.  Oftentimes we did this seasonally so we had the necessary supplies to last the winter.

        <p>Now, we are not so nomadic.  Some of us do travel to our homelands, especially if we live in a city.  We usually live in a house year-round.  Wherever we live on these lands, there is usually an abundance that Mother Earth provides for us.
