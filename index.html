            <p>OUR Ways are Strong and Sure.</p>  
            <p>OUR Ways include sharing what we have across the lands.</p>
            <p>Remember a time when our Ancestors had an abundance of goods and they traded with others?</p>
            <p>Our people traded so we could share our resources and procure the resources we did not have.  Many miles on land and water were travelled to secure the needed supplies.  Oftentimes we did this seasonally so we had the necessary supplies to last the winter.

            <p>Now, we are not so nomadic.  Some of us do travel to our homelands, especially if we live in a city.  We usually live in a house year-round.  Wherever we live on these lands, there is usually an abundance that Mother Earth provides for us.
