        <div class="remember">
            <p><strong>Remember</strong> a time when our Ancestors had an abundance of goods and they traded with others?  We did not use money.  We used food and supplies that we had on hand. Our people traded so we could share our resources and trade for things we did not have.  <p>Many miles on land and water were travelled to find and trade for the needed supplies.
            </p>
            <p>We lost touch.</p>  
            <p>Now we have the internet as a way of connecting and doing these trades.</p>
        </div class="remember"> 

        <h3>Connect with me and ask, maybe you can find what you are looking for.</h3>

        <h2>This is a place for you to come and find the fresh, wholesome supplies from the land and water that nurture your body, spirit, mind, and soul.</h2>
        
        <div class="who">
            <p><strong>Who am I?</strong> I am Netta.  
            <p>My birth certificate's name is Annette.</p>
            <p>I'm a mature mixed-blood Northern Dene woman with quite a story in life.
            <p> My Mom, Mary-Rose's, homeland was Rabbitskin, NWT, and my father, Ole's, homeland was Norway.
            <p>I grew up close to the land, eating wild meats, berries, medicines, and harvesting from the land and water. We respected and took care of things.</p>
            <p>In life, there are many things we cannot control, but what we do have some control over is what we put into our bodies.  Fresh foods from the land nurture us and bring us health and connection to ourselves, others, and Spirit.  This is important. Food connects us in many ways.  <strong> We can choose to eat healthy and can rebuild our strength as Indigenous people, and bring back OUR STRONG WAYS - we can do OUR WAY of trading.
            <p></strong> I am proud to walk my talk and have revived a trading system for the past 4 years. It's late 2024 now.</p>
            <p>I'd like to invite you to come and trade.  What do you want and what do you have?</p>
            <p>I believe we can connect and get strong together.  
            Our Indigenous blood runs deep.
